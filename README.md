# Dexed-Genesis
A library of Genesis (.opm) converted into open source Dexed (.syx) files


Dexed is an open source FM synth.

There are a ton of links for .opm files from Genesis carts. 
These contain the synth settings on the FM chip on the Genesis. However Dexed can't read the .opm format.
So I used the dxconvert below to convert the tracks into a .syx dexed readable format.

Archiving the FM synth settings here. 

If you want to use these with Dexed just place them into the Cart folder, and load them up in the load cart menu option.
